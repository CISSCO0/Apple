# Apple Products Website with React + Vite 

This project is an Apple website built with React and Vite. Originally a university (non-graded) assignment so I could take attendance (lol), I took it a step further to create a functional site featuring Apple products.

## Features

- **Minimal Setup**: Using React with Vite for a fast and efficient development environment.
- **No Bootstrap**: HTML and CSS were written by hand for custom styling.
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Ensures fast refresh during development.

## Getting Started

To set up this project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   node app.js

Plugins
This setup includes two options for React Fast Refresh:
@vitejs/plugin-react – Uses Babel for Fast Refresh
@vitejs/plugin-react-swc – Uses SWC for Fast Refresh
